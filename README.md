# Azure Monitoring Labs (AMELA​BS)

Welcome to the Azure Monitoring Labs repository! This collection provides hands-on, comprehensive lab environments for learning and demonstrating Azure Monitor capabilities, network security, and monitoring best practices.

## 🎯 Repository Overview

This repository contains independent lab environments, each focusing on different aspects of Azure monitoring and observability. The labs are optimized for **Azure Cloud Shell** execution to avoid local dependencies and are limited to specific Azure regions to ensure SKU availability and capacity constraints are met.

| Lab | Focus Area | Deployment Time | Difficulty |
|-----|------------|----------------|------------|
| [**azmon-lab-agents-essentials**](./azmon-lab-agents-essentials/) | Core Azure Monitor agents, data collection, and monitoring fundamentals | ~25-30 min | Beginner |
| [**azmon-lab-ampls-appinsights**](./azmon-lab-ampls-appinsights/) | Private Link Scope (AMPLS) with Application Insights in hub-spoke topology | ~25-30 min | Intermediate |

## 🚀 Quick Start

**For the fastest deployment experience, use Azure Portal Cloud Shell:**

### Lab 1: Azure Monitor Agents & Essentials Lab
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiagojfernandes/amelabs/refs/heads/main/azmon-lab-agents-essentials/init-lab.sh)
```

### Lab 2: AMPLS & Application Insights Lab  
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiagojfernandes/amelabs/refs/heads/main/azmon-lab-ampls-appinsights/init-lab.sh)
```
